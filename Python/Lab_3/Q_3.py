# 3. Quadratic equation is calculated as follows: axÂ² + bx + c = 0. Write a function which calculates solution set of a quadratic equation, _solve_quadratic_eqn_.

import math

def solve_quadratic_eqn(a, b, c):

  discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c

  if discriminant > 0:
    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)
    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)
    return root1, root2
  elif discriminant == 0:
    root = -b / (2 * a)
    return root, root
  else:
    real_part = -b / (2 * a)
    imaginary_part = math.sqrt(-discriminant) / (2 * a)
    root1 = complex(real_part, imaginary_part)
    root2 = complex(real_part, -imaginary_part)
    return root1, root2
